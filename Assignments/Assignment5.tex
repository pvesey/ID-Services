\Large\textbf{Assignment 5 - Contemporary Sitting Room Lighting, Power and Data (10\%)}\\
\end{flushleft}

In this assignment you are going to create a services design for a contemporary living room.  You are also required to layout furniture and fittings within the space provided.  You have been provided with a geo-located living room floor plan on Moodle.\\

The key deliverables of this assignment are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 3 High quality renders of the living room under artificial lighting
	\item 3 High quality renders of the living room under natural light on the 24th of June at 17:00
	\item 1 shadow analysis animation from an appropriate location within the room on the 24th of June from dawn to dusk
	\item Artificial Lighting schematic, including component list.
	\item 1 Illuminance Render of the room from an appropriate location.
	\item Data/Communications schematic depicting the location of data, satellite, terrestrial television and phone outlets.  You are not required to show cable routing.
	\item Power schematic depicting the location of all power outlets, and any switching arrangements you deem necessary
	\item Circuit diagram showing how each power circuit will be connected to the panel board
	\item Panel Board table as generated by Revit.  Please not that you will have to insert a panel board into your model in a suitable location, and connect it to an appropriate distribution system.  You will also have to connect your lighting circuits to this panel.
\end{enumerate}

I have posted a number of videos on YouTube that will assist you in this assignment.\\

Please note that you will require an Autodesk student account to undertake this assignment.  Also please note that producing high quality renders takes a considerable amount of processor time.\\

Final submission is to be a single zip file containing the model geometry, rendered images, drawings and animations.  Upload your single zip file to Moodle on or before the date shown.
