\Large\textbf{Assignment 3 (20\%)- Interior Lighting Scheme for Small House}\\
\end{flushleft}

In this assignment you will create an artificial lighting scheme for small house.  You have been provided with a Revit Model to assist you in this process.  This project will involve an iterative design approach.  The suggested workflow is provided below.  Your final deliverable will take the form of a zip file containing the Revit Model and pdf of the Revit Drawing depicting and detailing your final lighting schema. \\

\textbf{Suggested Workflow}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a simple lighting schema for the building and create and illuminace render using the Autodesk cloud service
	\item Examine the results and iterate your design to progressively improve it.  You should remain consistent of the various light levels that are expected in the various rooms of the house.
	\item Once your design is complete, create schedules of the lighting fixtures and fittings in each room. 
	\item Create a single A1 drawing depicting your design, final analysis and the fixtures \& fittings used. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Revit Model
	\item Revit Drawing
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reflected Ceiling Plans
			\item Internal Elevations (for sconce lights, if used)
			\item Illuminance Render of final analysis
			\item Schedules of light fittings and fixtures
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
