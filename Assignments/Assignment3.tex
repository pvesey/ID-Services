\end{flushleft}

In this assignment you are required to design and develop an eight page static HTML website that utilizes JavaScript, one or more external CSS files, and a Responsive Grid system\footnote{You may use Bootstrap, however you may not use any commercial, free, and/or open source templates}. The key deliverables for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pencil Project Wireframe Design for all web pages
	\item 8 Page Website, styled with external CSS file(s)
	\item JavaScript to enhance usability and user experience
	\item W3C Validated HTML and CSS
	\item Detailed Report on the design process and how the site fulfills the design objective described below.
	\item Publish the Website on a Web Server.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Senario}\\

%(2015-2016) You are required to redesign the Ormston House website.  The current site is available at \href{http://www.ormstonhouse.com/}{http://www.ormstonhouse.com/}.  The existing site requires cleaner structure, clearer navigation and other improvements.  Your redesigned site must maintain the existing functionality and message content.  You are not required to implement ticketing functionality, but your design should contain visual 'mock-ups' to represent its location, look and feel.  Preliminary examination of the site suggests that the organization is promoting exhibitions and events; your design must be cognizant of this and other message factors.
