\Large\textbf{Assignment 4 - Kitchen for Wheelchair User (45\%)}\\
\end{flushleft}

This assignment expands on the Kitchen Design assignment issued by Niall McPartlin.\\

In this assignment you are require to re-think your design to cater for a wheelchair user.  The building regulations establish wheelchair accessibility requirements, however these fall far short of creating a usable space for a wheelchair user. \\

You have had a one hour meeting with a wheelchair user who has indicated his needs and requirements to you.  You are to use the knowledge gained during this meeting, and your own research to inform your design.\\

All physical (as opposed to aesthetic) aspects of your design are to be considered.  These include, but are not limited to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Worktop heights
	\item Lighting positions and controls
	\item Appliance positioning and controls
	\item Power outlet positioning and control
	\item Sink position and faucet controls
	\item Oven, Fridge, Dishwasher configuration
	\item Voice Control for various systems.
\end{enumerate}
