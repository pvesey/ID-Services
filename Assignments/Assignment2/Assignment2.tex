\end{flushleft}


In this assignment you are required to create and deliver a 10 minute presentation on 5 Universal Principles of Design.  You will be allocated 5 principles by random selection in class.\\

The presentation of each principle should be limited to one or two slides.  The objective of your presentation is to introduce each concept to other class members, and identify how it can be used in interior design; not to provide an in depth examination of each.\\

All of these principles are well known in all forms of design from product to interior design.  Your research can be conducted through any media you choose.  It is worth noting that this list was compiled from the \href{www.lynda.com}{www.lynda.com} course entitled `Universal Principles of Design' by  William Lidwell \& Jill Butler.\\
