\textbf{Background}\\

% (2013-2014) You are required to develop a website to promote the art of Joan Mir\'{o} (1893-1983).  Mir\'{o} was 20$^{th}$ century painter and sculptor of considerable note.  His style developed through several schools including fauvism, realism and surrealism.  A consistent characteristic of his work was his use of color, in particular strong primary colors.  One of my favorite works is his collection of illustrated poems commonly known as 'Parler Seul'.\\
%You are required to develop a website to promote horology; specifically mechanical wrist watches (manual or automatic winding) from the 1960's to present day.  Mechanical watches went into major decline upon the development of quartz watches in the 1970's and 1980's; this period is known in the industry as the Quartz Crisis.  Since then mechanical watches have undergone a revival as high end luxury item.  Brands to look for are Omega, IWC, Breitling, Jaeger-LeCoultre, and A. Lange \& S\"{o}hne.  The Harry Winston Opus series are also worth investigating.\\

% (2015-2016)You are required to develop a website to promote manual focus, wet process photography; specifically Nikon or Canon manual focus cameras from the 1960's to present day.  Traditional film cameras went into major decline upon the development of digital photography. However, there remains a dedicated following for traditional wet process photography.  \\  

You are required to develop a website to promote Lebanese food to an Irish audience.\\  

\textbf{Key Design Objective}\\

% (2013-2014)Showcase the work of Joan Mir\'{o} and introduce the artist to a new, younger, audience.  You will need to include biography, details of past exhibitions, and reviews.  Use images, audio and video to reinforce your message where necessary.\\

% (2015-2016)The site should be targeted at people under 35 years looking for something different or more traditional.  Your objective is to educate and sell film cameras to them.  Your core message should be that image creation takes time, and old cameras will teach you how.  You should also present site visitors with useful resource links for film, chemical and paper. Use images, audio and video to reinforce your message where necessary.\\

The site should be targeted at people under 35 years looking for something different or something considered unusual.  Your objective is to attract and educate site visitors on the diverse nature of Lebanese food.  Your core message should be 'Exciting, Exotic, and Affordable'.  You should also present site visitors with useful resource links for recipes, restaurants, and reviews. Use images, audio and video to reinforce your message where necessary.\\

\textbf{Site Content \& Structure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Text - At least one sentence to describe what the article or paragraph will contain.  Remaining sentences may be filled out with Lorem Ipsum, but use a variety of extracts from Lorem.
	\item Images - Each image used must be listed in your report, along with the licensing and source information.   
	\item Video \& Audio - All video \& audio must be licensed under creative commons or similar open licensing system.  Each video and audio clip used must be listed in your report, along with the licensing and source information.

\textbf{Report}\\
Your report should be laid out in a professional manner, as would be done for a client.  This involves, \emph{inter-alia}, a cover page, table of contents, and logical sectioning.  Your report should include wireframe images, website screen shots, and other details necessary to communicate design intent.
